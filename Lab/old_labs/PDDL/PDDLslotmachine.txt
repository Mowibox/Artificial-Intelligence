Consider a deterministic slot-machine, with three buttons that allow to change
the value shown in the corresponding display. The admissible values are the
digits 0..4. Every button changes the value by adding 3 (modulo 5). The
sum of the three numbers can not be greater than 10 and lower than 4, unless
the three values are all equal.
The initial state should have different digits and the goal state with all
the digits equal.
