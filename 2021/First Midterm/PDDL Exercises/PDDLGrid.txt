Consider a grid representation of the environment, where an agent position
is characterized by the x,y coordinates plus the orientation (one of the 8
directions of the neighbouring cells). The environment contains obstacles,
whose position is known to the agents, so that the agent can not move into
a cell where there is an obstacle.
The agent can move (inside the grid) of 1 o 2 cells in the direction that it
is facing (if there are no obstacles). The agent can change its orientation by
+/- 45 or 90 degrees. The agent can not change orientation twice in a row.
Consider a grid 3x3, where the rows are numbered 1â€“3 starting from south
to north and from west to east. The initial state of the agent is in the south
west corner cell with orientation NE. Two obstacles are in position (2,2) and
(3,1). The goal is to reach location (1,3) facing north.
