Exercise 1
	1.1 model matryoshka doll problem with state space representation and its variable
	1.2 heuristic from this problem
	1.3 find a plan to solve this problem
	1.4 Execute A* up to the second level

	note: in februrary, same exercise but with frogs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8wkhae4Pvg

Exercise 2
	2.1 Apply MinMax algorithm on a tree
	2.2 Execute Alpha-Beta pruning -> write ALL variables
	2.3 Time complexity of MinMax and how much advantage we have with AlphaBeta pruning repsect to MinMax

Exercise 3
	3.1 First Order Logic -> transform NLP to CNF, later apply resolution
	3.2 Proof unification of two formula:  f( f(Y), W ,  g(Z, Y) ) unify f(X,X,g(Z,a) )?
	    Show the unification process
	

NOTE: I cannot remember all exercise, this is the general scheme used by the prof
